The episode was written by Bryan Cogman, and directed by Jack Bender.\\nBran Stark and Meera Reed are rescued from the White Walkers by Benjen Stark. Samwell Tarly returns to his family\\'s home in Horn Hill, accompanied by Gilly and little Sam; Jaime Lannister attempts to rescue the Queen, Margaery Tyrell; Arya Stark defies the Faceless Men; and Daenerys Targaryen rides on Drogon and emboldens her newly acquired khalasar.\\n\"Blood of My Blood\" was positively received by critics who praised the return of several notable characters, including Benjen Stark, Walder Frey and Edmure Tully. Further praise was given to other plot points, such as Samwell\\'s return to Horn Hill, and Arya\\'s decision to return to being a Stark rather than a disciple of the Many-Faced God. The episode title is a reference to a famous Dothraki saying used between a Khal and his bloodriders. Filming of Bran\\'s visions was put together precisely and also very carefully chosen. In the United States, the episode achieved a viewership of 6.71 million in its initial broadcast.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'name': '420_Blood_of_My_Blood.txt'}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '56afb632d81d5c4382b45fa145805339'}>, <Document: {'content': \"\\n===Beyond the Wall===\\nBran and Meera continue to flee the wights. Bran, still in his visions, witnesses several events: Jaime Lannister killing King Aerys Targaryen, a dragon flying over the Red Keep, his fall from Winterfell which left him paralyzed, the Night King transforming Craster's last son into a White Walker, the massacre at Hardhome, Ned Stark's beheading, the murder of Catelyn and Robb Stark at the Red Wedding, and wildfire exploding beneath King's Landing. As the wights close in, a black-clad rider appears and pulls Meera and Bran onto his horse, allowing them to escape.\\nBran awakens to find the rider is his uncle, Benjen Stark, who had gone missing beyond the Wall. Benjen explains that he was stabbed by a White Walker during a ranging and was left to die and become another wight, but was saved by the Children of the Forest by being impaled with dragonglass.

Sam warns Gilly not to mention that she is a Wildling, due to his father Randyll's hatred of Wildlings. They are warmly greeted by Sam's mother Melessa and sister Talla.\\nAt dinner, Randyll insults Sam's bookishness, weight, and lack of fighting prowess. Gilly defends Sam, mentioning that Sam killed a Thenn and a White Walker. When Sam's brother Dickon insists that White Walkers don't exist, Gilly declares that she saw the act herself, but in doing so reveals her Wildling heritage. Disgusted, Randyll further insults Sam and Gilly, prompting Melessa and Talla to leave the room with Gilly in anger. Randyll tells Sam that Gilly and Little Sam can remain at Horn Hill, but that he must never set foot in Horn Hill again. Sam bids farewell to Gilly, but then changes his mind and decides to bring her and Little Sam with him to the Citadel.

Aware of their chances of dying in the upcoming battle and Arya wanting to experience sex, Arya and Gendry sleep together. Later that night, Arya hears the signal alerting her that the White Walkers' army has arrived.\\nArya fights in the battle against the dead with Sandor Clegane and Beric Dondarrion. Beric sacrifices himself to allow Arya and the Hound to escape the wights. A battered Arya sprints through the corridors of Winterfell and encounters Melisandre, who suggests to Arya that she is meant to kill the Night King. In the Godswood, just as the Night King is about to kill Bran, Arya sneaks up and stabs the Night King with the Valyrian steel dagger Bran gave her. Upon killing the Night King, the White Walkers and wights are all destroyed. \\nIn the aftermath of the battle, Arya is proposed to by Gendry, who had just been legitimised as a Baratheon by Daenerys. Arya declines, as she does not want the life of a lady. Sansa and Arya tell Jon they don't trust Daenerys, but Jon defends her.

Arya thanks the Hound, calling him by his name for the first time. She tries and fails to save the smallfolk, narrowly avoiding being incinerated in Daenerys' attack on the city, but survives. In the aftermath, Arya is reunited with Jon and warns him that he and the Starks are not safe from Daenerys. Jon tries but is unable to dissuade Daenerys from further destruction and ultimately assassinates her. He is imprisoned.

Each khal and his khalasar owe fealty to a ruling council of royal priestesses, called the dosh khaleen, whose members are each a former khal\\'s consort, called a khaleesi during the reign of her husband, one who became part of the dosh khaleen following his death.\\nDothraki are expert riders and their horses are of prime importance in their culture, used for food, transportation, raw materials, warfare, and establishing social standing.

Benioff also stated that the important part of her return to Winterfell is her relationship with Sansa Stark, with Weiss following up by stating that the intention of the scene in the crypts where they are reunited was to \"lay down the beginnings of the storyline where Sansa realizes what Arya is now.\"\\nSpeaking about the revelation of the cave drawings with the Children of the Forest and the First Men, Benioff stated that the inspiration for the drawings were the cave paintings created by prehistoric men that were found in France, and that the scene was meant to be evocative in noting the thousands of years that have passed since the drawings were created.\\nIn writing the battle between the Lannister army, and Daenerys\\' Dothraki and Drogon, Weiss stated that one of the most exciting elements of the fight involved the fact that two main characters were on opposite sides of the battlefield, and that it is \"impossible to really want any one of them to win, and impossible to want any one of them to lose,\" according to Weiss. He also compared the introduction of a dragon in medieval warfare to using an F-16 fighter aircraft in a medieval battle.

The Hound declares that Sansa would not have experienced the horrors she faced had she fled King's Landing with him, but Sansa acknowledges that her experiences made her wiser. At the war council, Sansa and Daenerys disagree over giving the Northern army time to recover before marching on King's Landing. After the council, Sansa and Arya tell Jon they don't trust Daenerys but Jon defends Daenerys. Jon confides he is the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark after swearing Sansa and Arya to secrecy. Sansa reveals this to Tyrion.\\nDaenerys takes King's Landing, but lays waste to the surrendered populace during which Cersei is also killed. Jon tries but fails to dissuade Daenerys from further destruction and ultimately assassinates her. When Jon is arrested by the Unsullied, Sansa camps the Northern army outside the city and travels to King's Landing to convene a council to determine the fates of Jon, Tyrion, and Westeros. Tyrion suggests Bran be crowned king, to near-unanimous approval. Arya and Sansa abstain, and Sansa asserts to Bran that the North has sacrificed too much to remain part of the Seven Kingdoms, declaring the North's independence. Sansa, Arya, and Bran bid farewell to Jon, who is exiled. Sansa returns to Winterfell and is crowned Queen in the North.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'name': '332_Sansa_Stark.txt'}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'da9e64cf6cf4528a8e8502b528bea3e7'}>,\n",
            "               <Document: {'content': '\\n===Reception===\\nSophie Turner plays the role of Sansa Stark in the television series\\nAs her storyline has progressed, Sansa has received critical acclaim for the development of her character and her emergence from a naive young girl to a strong young woman. \\'\\'Rolling Stone\\'\\' ranked Sansa as No. 4 on a list of the \"Top 40 \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\' Characters\", saying that Sansa is \"often overlooked in favor of her killer kid sister\", but that her \"quiet, innate political shrewedness and emotional strength have enabled her to survive\", and calling her \"the show\\'s best-kept secret\". In a ranking of the 48 best \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\' characters listed in the main credits in the first five seasons on the website \\'\\'The Wrap\\'\\', Sansa was ranked at No. 4, ahead of the more popular Daenerys Targaryen, Jon Snow, and Tyrion Lannister, saying that \"Sansa has been kind of great in Season 6, turning into the sort of badass we always hoped but never thought she actually could become\".\\nIn an article published on \\'\\'Mic.\\'\\'com, Julianne Ross says that \"the elder Stark daughter is often cited as one of the most reviled characters on \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\'\", while also saying that \"not coincidentally, Sansa Stark is also one of the most classically feminine characters on the show.\" Ross criticized the heavy hatred for Sansa, particularly in contrast to \"her universally (and rightly) adored tomboy little sister Arya\", stating that Sansa \"arguably gets a disproportionate amount of fan hate because she doesn\\'t fit the narrow \\'strong female character\\' mold we\\'re used to rooting for.\"  Blogger Rhiannon Thomas of \\'\\'Feminist Fiction\\'\\' wrote in 2012 that \"the focus on this sort of female character - the oft-cited \\'strong female character\\' - seems to suggest that femininity is still \\'\\'bad,\\'\\' and that women can only be strong by adopting stereotypically male roles and attitudes\". Thomas went on to say that \"in an abusive situation that would break so many people, Sansa survives\" and that she has a \"woman\\'s courage\" that \"keeps her alive and in the game where characters like Arya would not last five minutes\".\\nIn an article published on MTV.com by Crystal Bell titled \"Sansa Stark is the Only \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\' Hero Worth Rooting For\", Bell writes: \"Sansa is the most relatable character in George R.R. Martin\\'s canon. She\\'s often despised for having no agency, but the way I see it, Sansa is hated for being a woman. Unlike Brienne, Arya, Cersei, and Margaery -- models of the \"strong female character\" archetype—Sansa\\'s passivity denotes weakness. She doesn\\'t have cool swordplay skills like her sister Arya; she isn\\'t a smart seductress like Margaery Tyrell or a fierce queen like Cersei. She is the epitome of femininity on \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\', and therefore, she is dismissed.\" Bell went on to say: \"However, Sansa\\'s greatest strength as a character has been her unwavering resilience. She was tortured and humiliated for seasons by the unhinged man-boys around her. She\\'s been the subject of everyday sexism and misogyny since day one. And yet, she survives, even as armor-clad heroes fall before her. She is the show\\'s survivor. She continuously \\'\\'endures\\'\\' the pain and humiliation of being a woman in Westeros. Just because Sansa doesn\\'t wield a sword as fiercely as Arya and Brienne, or command a horde of dragons like Daenerys Targaryen, doesn\\'t make her any less of a hero.\"\\nSansa received particular acclaim in Season 6 of the show, during which she began her quest to retake her family home and exact revenge on those who wronged her. In an interview with \\'\\'The New York Times\\'\\', actress Sophie Turner said that \"she\\'s Sansa no longer a pawn in anyone\\'s game; she\\'s no longer a prisoner...she\\'s the one taking charge and doing her own thing, which is very exciting\". Megan Garber of \\'\\'The Atlantic\\'\\' praised the show\\'s decision to have Sansa be the one orchestrating Ramsay\\'s death in Battle of the Bastards, saying that \"In the end, it was Sansa and her abuser, alone again in a darkened chamber; in the end though, it was Sansa making the decisions about who would be the victim.\"  On the scene, Turner said: \"It\\'s amazing. It\\'s Sansa\\'s first kill and it\\'s such a strong moment for her because all her life she\\'s been affected by these men who have just done such terrible things to her....\"\\nFollowing the penultimate Season 6 episode, Bennett Madison of \\'\\'Vanity Fair\\'\\' wrote \"When Sansa icily reminds her dopey brother that \\'No one can protect you\\', it\\'s because she\\'s always been on her own. As far back as King\\'s Landing, Sansa\\'s between quietly protecting herself, working on her stitchery while taking cool measure of everything going on around her, learning how to game the system, and slithering through situations that would have gotten the best of the show\\'s more flashy or impulsive characters. In \\'Battle of the Bastards\\', she got to show a little flash of her own; by being defiantly, gloriously correct in her convictions, by saving the day with her foresight and savvy, and by feeding Ramsay to the dogs.\"  Turner later told \\'\\'Time\\'\\' magazine about how gratifying it was to watch Sansa\\'s development during Season 6 and defended the show on its cruel treatment of women: \"In my opinion, \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\' is not sexist, and it\\'s accurate to medieval time. The show puts social boundaries on the women, and they break out of these boundaries.\"', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'name': '332_Sansa_Stark.txt'}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '2ba1320d39d9464f3a92d583106aaae1'}>,\n",

Though Sansa is reluctant to marry Ramsay, as his father Roose had personally murdered Robb, Baelish persuades her by claiming that the marriage will give her the opportunity to avenge her family. On the way to Winterfell, they encounter Brienne of Tarth, who had sworn to Catelyn Stark to take Sansa to safety and tries to convince Sansa to come with her; Baelish has her chased off by his men, but Brienne follows Sansa to Winterfell regardless.

He proceeds to flay the maid who had told Sansa of the signal, and forces Sansa to look at her corpse. Furious, Sansa confronts Reek, who admits that he had failed to capture Sansa's brothers Bran and Rickon, and killed two farm boys in their place. While the Boltons prepare to battle Stannis Baratheon's advancing forces, Sansa signals to Brienne, unaware that she has left to kill Stannis.
